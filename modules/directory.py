directory.py - Python Practice Shell

A module created for supplying the required functions to the shell application. The functions and classes defined in this module ease many tasks at the shell application, in general way they are used in executing the task assigned by the user via the commands. This module contains functions and classes related to directory handling and other such stuff.

The function when called requires an argument, the directory location of where we want to list the files in the tree format. Also, note the algorithm used by the function is very different. It first iterates through an directory and then append the listed files to a class variable (property) list, and then proceed to each sub-directories using the same algorithm. Thus, we need also to define an object with the class FilesLister, before using this method alone. The class variable where this function saves the fetched file list is a list / array type data object named as files (self.files). """
